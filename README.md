# Guess the Number
A simple number guessing game. The computer will randomly choose a secret number. The secret number will be in a random range of 10-100, this means that some games will be easier or harder than the previous. Example, your first game could be guessing between '1 and 20', your next game could be between '1 and 50' or '1 and 10', and etc. You will have 6 tries to guess the secret number each time.

Notes: will update this ReadMe sometime later with a demo and basic guide.
